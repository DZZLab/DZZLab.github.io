      <p>Over the course of 3 weeks, we collected 62 survey responses and conducted 11 interviews,
         as well including expert interviews from 2 librarians. From these responses, we found that there was a high demand for privacy, comfort, and outlets.</p>

      <p>With our these factors, engineered 3 "pretotypes" to user-test over the course of the next week.</p>

      <p>From user-testing, 88% of users chose my Ogi-fan design for its intuitiveness and effective utility from the fan inspired design. 
        It provided an unintrusive addition to current study spaces with flexible aesthetics for interior design - as well as the additional outlets at the base. </p>
